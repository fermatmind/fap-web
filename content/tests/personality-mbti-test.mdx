# MBTI Personality Test

## Executive Summary

FermatMind MBTI assessment helps you identify your likely type and preference strengths in one flow. You get a clear type result, axis-level interpretation, and practical suggestions you can apply to work, communication, and growth.

## Intro

MBTI describes personality through four dimensions: E/I, S/N, T/F, and J/P. This test is designed for fast self-discovery with readable explanations rather than rigid labeling, so you can understand both your dominant preference and situation-based flexibility.

## FAQ

### Is this MBTI test free?

Yes. The core test experience and baseline interpretation are free.

### How long does it take?

This version is designed for around 15 minutes and includes 144 questions.

### Is the result a diagnosis?

No. It is a self-discovery tool, not a medical or psychological diagnosis.

## How To Use Your Result

Start with your type and the four preference dimensions, then focus on one real scenario this week: teamwork, decision-making, or planning habits. Apply one small behavior change and observe the outcome.
