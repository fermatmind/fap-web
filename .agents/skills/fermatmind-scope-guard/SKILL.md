description: Use for fap-web scope control when Codex must verify changed files, detect unrelated dirty work, and stop work that drifts outside an approved PR or task boundary.
---

## Purpose
Guard fap-web work so Codex changes only the declared files and behavior for the current task.

## When to use
- Use before editing, staging, committing, pushing, or preparing a PR in fap-web.
- Use when a dirty worktree, broad diff, generated artifact, or accidental source change may affect scope.

## When not to use
- Do not use as permission to expand a task.
- Do not use to justify staging unrelated files.

## Hard invariants
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Do not stage unrelated dirty files.
- Do not process Informational findings unless explicitly requested.
- Do not expose exploit-ready details in public PR titles/bodies.
- Do not merge unless required checks pass and scope is clean.
- Do not close security findings unless source/test evidence proves fixed.
- Stop if active Critical/High/Medium appears during Low/Informational work.
- Do not weaken previously fixed security boundaries.
- Required checks for fap-web are build, contracts, verify-big5-contract-freeze, and verify-enneagram-contract-freeze.
- Frontend must not add or modify public editorial content for CMS-backed surfaces.

## Standard workflow
1. Capture the declared scope in concrete paths and behavior.
2. Inspect current branch, upstream, and `git status --short`.
3. Compare changed files against the declared scope before staging.
4. Treat package files, workflows, configs, generated SEO artifacts, public assets, routes, tests, and app source as out of scope unless explicitly named.
5. Stage only path-limited files after all checks pass.
6. Report any unrelated dirty files without touching them.

## Acceptance commands
```bash
cd /Users/rainie/Desktop/GitHub/fap-web && pnpm typecheck
cd /Users/rainie/Desktop/GitHub/fap-web && NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.fermatmind.com pnpm build
cd /Users/rainie/Desktop/GitHub/fap-web && pnpm test:contract
cd /Users/rainie/Desktop/GitHub/fap-web && git diff --check
```

## Output contract
- Always report changed files, acceptance commands run, PR URL if a PR was created, CI status, Deploy Application or deploy/runtime status when relevant, merge commit if merged, branch cleanup status when cleanup is requested, revalidation status for security-related work, stop reason when blocked, and confirmation that no unrelated files were touched.
- Report declared scope, changed files, unrelated dirty files, staged files, checks run, and any stop reason.

## Stop conditions
- Stop if active Critical/High/Medium appears during Low/Informational work, required checks fail, Deploy Application or deploy/runtime status regresses where relevant, the worktree is dirty in a way that cannot be isolated, scope drift appears, product/runtime behavior is ambiguous, closure would lack source/test evidence, or production deploy/rollback is requested without explicit manual confirmation.
- Stop when changed files drift outside scope, path-limited staging cannot isolate the work, or repository state is ambiguous.
